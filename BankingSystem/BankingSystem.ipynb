    "# Problem Statement: \n",
    "Write a Python program that simulates a simple banking system. The program should have the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Account Creation:\n",
    "a. Allow users to create a new bank account.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Prompt the user to enter their name and initial deposit amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Generate a unique 7 digit account number for each new account.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Store account details (name, account number, balance) in a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Deposit and Withdrawal:\n",
    "a. Implement functions for deposit and withdrawal.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Allow users to deposit money into their account and update the balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Ensure that withdrawals are only allowed if the account has sufficient balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Display appropriate messages for successful transactions or insufficient balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Account Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Implement a function to display account information.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Allow users to input their account number and view their account details, including name and current balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Transaction History:\n",
    "a. Keep track of transaction history for each account.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Display the transaction history upon user request.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Include details such as date, type of transaction (deposit or withdrawal), and amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Display withdrawals above specific amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Display subset of transactions by their transaction index. For instance, display the history between 2nd and 4th transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Error Handling:\n",
    "a. Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Ensure that the program does not crash due to invalid inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Display helpful error messages for users.\n"
